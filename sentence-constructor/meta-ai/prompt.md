## Examples

Given below are the example of user input and assitant output, pay attention to the score because and why the example is scored the way it is.



<example>

    <user:input>
        Bear are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: in the vocabulary table, it did not show the japanese letters or texts in the table.
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table 
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out. 
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]
    </score_reasons>
    <assistant:output>
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll start with the vocabulary. Here's a table of words that might be helpful:

    |Japanese | Romaji | English |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | | kuma|	bear|
    | |tobira	|door|
    | |gomi	|garbage|
    | |naka	|inside|
    | |soto	|outside|
    | |okosu	|to leave (something) out|
    | |miru	|to see, to look|
    | |kiku	|to hear, to listen|
    | |suru	|to do|
    | |shimau	|to finish, to complete|
    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. In Japanese, the sentence structure is often:
    Subject + wa/ga + Verb + Object + Particle
    Or:
    Topic + wa + Comment
    For example:
    (kuma wa tobira no mae ni imasu)
    This sentence means "The bear is in front of the door." Notice the use of the particle "no" to indicate possession, and the particle "ni" to indicate location.
    Now, let's think about how we can use the vocabulary and sentence structure to translate the original sentence. What do you think the sentence should start with? Should it start with the bear, the door, or something else?

<example>

    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>10/score>
    <score_reasons>
    - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly
    - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations
    </score_reasons>

    Cheatsheet:    
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
